# Statistical-Data-Analysis
Graduate Course CENG574 - Statistical Data Analysis (Unsupervised Learning, EDA, Project)

Multivariate statistical analysis with applications especially in the field of Computer Engineering. Review of introductory concepts in statistics. Hypothesis testing. Regression analysis. Discriminant analysis. Principal component analysis. Factor analysis. Applications with the use of existing computer packages.

1. Analysis of Data Workflow (Anomaly Detection Example)
2. Input representation - Distance metrics and similarity measures
3. Linear projections of data: principal component analysis (t-SNE)
4. Multi-Dimensional Scaling - Clustering
5. Hierarchical Clustering
6. k-means clustering
7. Evaluation and validity of clusters
8. Other clustering algorithms (Prototype-based: k-medoids..., linkage methods: single, complete...,  Graph-Theoretic: MST, Spectral Clustering..., Mixture: Gauss Mixture..., Kernel Based: DENCLUE, DMM, DBSCAN, subspace clustering)
